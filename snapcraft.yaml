  Why?
  We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication.
  No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is serving it.
  No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.
  Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
  Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is unavailable.
